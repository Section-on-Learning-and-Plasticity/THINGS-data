# THINGS-data

[THINGS-data](https://elifesciences.org/articles/82580) is a collection of large-scale datasets for the study of natural object representations in brain and behavior. It includes functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings, and 4.70 million similarity judgments in response to thousands of images from the [THINGS object concept and image database](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0223792).

# Code Repositories

This repository the scripts and notebooks for reproducing the neuroimaging analyses presented in the [THINGS-data paper](https://elifesciences.org/articles/82580). It is structured into two sub-folders reflecting the two neuroimaging data modalities: 
- [MRI](MRI)
- [MEG](MEG)

## figshare

THINGS-data is hosted as a collection of data objects on figshare.

Besides the raw data, this collection includes a data derivatives such as preprocessed versions of both the fMRI and MEG data. Additional derivatives for the fMRI data include single trial response estimates, cortical surface maps, noise ceiling estimates, and regions of interest.

You can browse the collection and download individual parts which are relevant for your research.

For smaller files, you can simply click the `Download` button!

If you plan to download larger data objects, it might make sense to start this process in the command line. Simply right-click on the `Download`` button and copy the link address. Executing the following code in the command line to begin the download process for that file. 
```
# This link downloads the fMRI single trial responses
wget -O betas_csv.zip https://plus.figshare.com/ndownloader/files/36789690
```
Since downloading larger data object may take some time, it can make sense to run this process in the background with tools such as `screen` or `tmux`.


## OpenNeuro
